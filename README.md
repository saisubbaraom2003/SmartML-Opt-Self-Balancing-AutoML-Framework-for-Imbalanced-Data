# SmartML-Opt: Self-Balancing AutoML Framework for Imbalanced Data

This project implements a modular AutoML pipeline designed to improve classification performance on imbalanced tabular datasets, specifically demonstrated on the Bank Marketing dataset.

Key features include:
- Dynamic SMOTE sampling with feedback loop
- Integrated feature selection in AutoML pipeline
- Hyperparameter optimization of multiple classifiers
- Benchmarking against TPOT, AutoSklearn, and LightAutoML
- Experiment tracking using MLflow
- Visualization of results including ROC, confusion matrix, and precision-recall curves

This project is aligned with Megaminds IT Services requirements for innovative ML solutions addressing real-world imbalanced classification challenges.
